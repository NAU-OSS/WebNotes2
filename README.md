# WebNotes 2.0

## What is this project?
WebNotes is a Google Chrome Extension which allows users to create virtual sticky notes on NAU's Canvas page. Mainly writen in JavaScript, this project is simple to contribute to and test on locally.

The extension lets users attach notes to specific course pages, share them with classmates, and collaborate through public annotations. The project is primarily written in JavaScript and uses standard Chrome Extension APIs, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend.

## Why is this project useful?
